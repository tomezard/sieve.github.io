# Fusion Ecology

This website is under development. I'll be gradually transitioning the [older version](http://fusionecology.org/FusionEcology/index.html) here if I can work out how. 

I am fortunate to work with [awesome people](https://tomezard.github.io/team). 

We integrate mathematics, statistics, systematics, geochemistry and computer vision in [our research interests](https://tomezard.github.io/research).

My official University of Southampton page is [here](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/oes/about/staff/te1e12.page).
