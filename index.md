In **SIEVE**, **S**outhampton **I**nterdisciplinary **EV**olutionary **E**cology, we integrate computer vision, geochemistry, mathematics, statistics and systematics to do the best evolutionary ecology [research](https://tomezard.github.io/research) we can.

We are a [research group](https://tomezard.github.io/team) associated with [Tom Ezard](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/oes/about/staff/te1e12.page) based within [Ocean and Earth Science]() at the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/oes/research/index.page), UK. As the Honorary Treasurer for the [British Ecological Society](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/), an Associate for the [Society for the Study of Evolution](https://www.evolutionsociety.org/) owned [Evolution](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15585646) journal and a member of [The Micropalaeontological Society](https://www.tmsoc.org/), I am proud to support the scientific missions of learned societies.

If you feel like our research portfolio interests you, then I'm always happy to hear from researchers wishing to develop independent fellowship proposals to join our group or prospetive PhD candidates who might seek funding through our [INSPIRE](https://inspire-dtp.ac.uk/) Doctoral Training Programme. I will link to funded opportunities here when they are available. This year we are searching for a PhD candidate to explore [how species emerge](https://noc.ac.uk/gsnocs/project/how-do-species-emerge).
