In **SIEVE, **S**outhampton **I**nterdisciplinary **EV**olutionary **E**cology, we integrate mathematics, statistics, systematics, geochemistry and computer vision to do evolutionary ecology [research](https://tomezard.github.io/research).

This website is under development. I'll be gradually transitioning the [older version](http://fusionecology.org/FusionEcology/index.html) here if I can work out how. 

We are a [research group](https://tomezard.github.io/team) associated with Tom Ezard at the University of Southampton, UK.
