## Welcome to an in-development new website

This website is under development. I'll be gradually transitioning the [older version](http://fusionecology.org/FusionEcology/index.html) here.

## Lab Values

Who we are:
- We celebrate diversity in all its forms.
- We bring together scientists of different backgrounds and support individuals who wish to branch out into new disciplines.
- We value the particular strengths, skillsets and working preferences of individuals.
- We develop independence among all members with the goal of providing the freedom to creatively explore related questions.
- We are not insular as individuals and do not view our lab as an island.

How we work:
- We integrate small projects to answer bigger picture questions.
- We are physically and electronically approachable whenever practicable; we run flexible office hours with an open-door policy.
- We do not deny our failures, and interrogate our mistakes so we can build better strategies for success.
- We believe in the principles of open science and develop skills to implement them in everything we do.
- We finish tasks in a timely fashion for each project. We communicate our findings through whichever medium is appropriate.
- We are passionate about our jobs but not to the detriment of our lives.
