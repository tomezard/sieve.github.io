# Interdisciplinary evolutionary ecology at the University of Southampton

This website is under development. I'll be gradually transitioning the [older version](http://fusionecology.org/FusionEcology/index.html) here if I can work out how. 

You can also see my [official University of Southampton page](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/oes/about/staff/te1e12.page). In time, you will be able to read about [the awesome people I work with](https://tomezard.github.io/team). We integrate mathematics, statistics, systematics, geochemistry and computer vision in [our research interests](https://tomezard.github.io/research).
