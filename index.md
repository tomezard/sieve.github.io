# SIEVE

In #S#outhampton #I#nterdisciplinary #EV#olutionary #E#cology, we integrate mathematics, statistics, systematics, geochemistry and computer vision to address [research](https://tomezard.github.io/research) questions in evolutionary ecology.

This website is under development. I'll be gradually transitioning the [older version](http://fusionecology.org/FusionEcology/index.html) here if I can work out how. 

I am fortunate to work with [awesome people](https://tomezard.github.io/team).
