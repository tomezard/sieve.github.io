In **SIEVE**, **S**outhampton **I**nterdisciplinary **EV**olutionary **E**cology, we integrate computer vision, geochemistry, mathematics, statistics and systematics to do the best evolutionary ecology [research](https://tomezard.github.io/research) we can.

We are a [research group](https://tomezard.github.io/team) associated with [Tom Ezard](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/oes/about/staff/te1e12.page) based within [Ocean and Earth Science](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/oes/research/index.page) at the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk), UK. As the Honorary Treasurer for the [British Ecological Society](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/), an Associate for the [Society for the Study of Evolution](https://www.evolutionsociety.org/) owned [Evolution](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15585646) journal and a member of [The Micropalaeontological Society](https://www.tmsoc.org/), I am proud to support the scientific missions of learned societies.

If our research portfolio interests you, I'm always happy to hear from researchers wishing to either develop independent fellowship proposals or to join us as prospective PhD candidates who might seek funding through our [INSPIRE](https://inspire-dtp.ac.uk/) Doctoral Training Programme. This year we are searching for a PhD candidate to explore [how species emerge](https://noc.ac.uk/gsnocs/project/how-do-species-emerge). I will link to funded opportunities here when they are available. 

Please do get in touch with me at t.ezard (at) soton (dot) ac (dot) uk. I'm on [twitter](https://twitter.com/tomezard) too.
