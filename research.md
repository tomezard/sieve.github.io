# Research Interests
We are interested in how the structure of populations and communities interacts with environmental changes to determine ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Our interests are necessarily diverse

## The bridge from micro- to macroevolution 
The emergence of new species is controlled by the link between environmental cues and organismal responses during life, but the contrasting temporal and biological scales involved create major problems for empirical study. As a consequence, the role of developmental plasticity during the emergence of new species is poorly understood. The University of Southampton has a [cluster of activity](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/life-sciences/living-systems/evolution/index.page#related_projects) in this area. We lead projects that leverage the mature fossil phylogeny, unprecedented geochemical understanding and astonishing temporal resolution of planktonic foraminifera. We consider this system an ideal window into processes that many groups of organisms experienced historically, but which are not preserved in enough abundance for analysis. The [PISTON](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/oes/research/projects/piston-does-developmental-plasticity-influence-speciation.page) project will stimulate further development of theoretical models of speciation by providing the first empirical tests of key assumptions that underpin important areas of macroevolutionary theory, community ecology and palaeoclimate reconstruction.
