## Our Lab Values
Who we are:
- We celebrate diversity and bring together scientists of different backgrounds. 
- We value the particular strengths, skillsets and working preferences of individuals. 
- We develop independence and support individuals who wish to branch out into new or related disciplines.
- We are not insular as individuals and do not view our lab as an island.

How we work:
- We integrate small projects to answer bigger picture questions.
- We are physically and electronically approachable whenever practicable.
- We believe in the principles of open science and develop skills to implement them in everything we do.
- We do not deny our failures, and interrogate our mistakes so we can build better strategies for success.
- We finish tasks in a timely fashion for each project.
- We communicate our findings through whichever medium is appropriate.
- We are passionate about our jobs but not to the detriment of our lives.
